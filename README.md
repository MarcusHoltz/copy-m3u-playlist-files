# Copy music files in a playlist for export

This script will - collect files in your music playlist, order the songs, and copy them into a new directory. 

Now can burn your collection to a CD, or export the playlist for friends. 👍

## Using copy-m3u-playlist-files-to-directory

The script can, optionally, take two arguments:

- The name of the m3u playlist file.

- The location to place the contents of the playlist. 

> If neither is specified, the script defaults to `playlist.m3u` and `current working directory`.


* * *

### Example 

Using the bash version of this script as an example, run this Bash script with a command like:

```
bash copy-m3u-playlist-files-to-directory.sh name-of-playlist.m3u /home/user/Music/somefiles
```
